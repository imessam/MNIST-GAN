# Trainig GAN with MNIST handwritten digits dataset

- GAN trainig on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, from simple architecture to a complex one.
- Please run the notebooks "MNIST GAN #" where # is order of the architecture complexity from simple to complex.
- To see my trainig output, check "MNIST GAN #.html".
